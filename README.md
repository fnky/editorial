Editorial is a blog and editor interface for my personal website. It's powered
by Next.js, Recoil, rich-markdown-editor and more.

It is still under development and lacks a few features.

## Features

- **Persistence** — Persists all changes locally and syncs with backend service
  to save changes remotely frequently.
- **Block-based Markdown Editor** — The editor is powered by
  [outline/rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor)
  and provides a fast way to write posts, using markdown under the hood.

More features will be added in the future.

## Contributing

You can contribute at any time. Clone the repository and install dependencies is
all you need.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fnky/editorial.git
cd editorial
yarn
```
