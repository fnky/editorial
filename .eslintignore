# ESLint is setup to run on everything by default to ensure maximum lintiness
# However, ESLint doesn't support every file type, and some files dont need to
# be linted. So they are "ignored" using glob patterns in this file in a similar
# fashion to .gitignore

# third party deps dont need linting
node_modules

# nor do built things
dist
.next
.temp

# tests
.nyc_output
coverage

# generated files
generated

# public assets

# these things are just not supported by eslint
